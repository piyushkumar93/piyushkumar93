## 🚀 About Me

I talk to pandas 🐼 more than people (yes, I mean `import pandas as pd`) and I’ve been training ML models like Rocky trains for fights 🥊. As a 2nd-year undergrad, I’m already working on projects that:
- Predict churn for telecom companies in real time
- Forecast electric vehicle sales using SARIMAX
- Predict student performance with regression models

I'm not just passionate about machine learning — I'm obsessed with deploying it, scaling it, and turning datasets into insights (and sometimes memes).
